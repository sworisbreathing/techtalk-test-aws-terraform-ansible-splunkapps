  <h1>Distributed Indexing Performance</h1>

  <p>
    This view provides three panels that help you monitor indexing performance in a distributed deployment. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Real-time indexing rate and latency</b><br />Provides statistics on indexing throughput and latency, grouped by the selected metadata field.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Estimated indexing rate</b><br />Compares indexing rates across indexers in a distributed deployment. You can drill down to the Indexing Performance view to access details for a specific indexer.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Fill ratio of data processing queues</b><br />Compares the fill ratio of data processing queues for all indexers in a distributed deployment. Helps you analyze bottlenecks that appear in in the data processing pipelines. You can drill down to the Indexing Performance view to access details for a specific indexer.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Caution: </b>The search in this view initiates a real-time (all time) search that evaluates all incoming data. The search should not run indefinitely. Use the search controls on the right to pause, cancel, or finalize the search.</p>

  <h2>Real-time indexing rate and latency</h2>

  <p>
    Indexing latency is the difference between indexing time and the timestamp extracted from the event:
  </p>
  <p><code><i>indexing latency</i> = _indextime - _time</code></p>
  <p>
    This panel displays indexing latency for currently indexed events. The search in this view uses the <i>real-time (all time)</i> time range, to ensure that all incoming events are shown regardless of their extracted time stamp. Note that the latency measured here is affected by how old your events are when you expose them.
  </p>
    
  <p>At times, this table shows negative latency. This can happen for the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The system that wrote the log timestamp has a system clock set in the future. This typically explains negative latencies in single or double digits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The system from which the logs originate is in a different time zone, but Splunk is unaware of this. This can happen if the TZ is not present in the log timestamp, cannot be extracted, or has not been declared in <code>props.conf</code>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Estimated indexing rate</h2>
  <p>
    This panel gives you a picture of the estimated indexing rate in a Splunk Enterprise distributed deployment. By default, it displays one chart per indexer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deselect <b>Split by indexer</b> to show the aggregate rate for all indexers.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can exclude the search-head from the results by deselecting the <b>Include search-head</b> checkbox.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click the chart of an indexer to open a new window with the Indexing Performance view focused on that instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The indexing rate in this panel is an estimate, based on data in the metrics log file (<code>group = per_index_throughput</code>). The metrics log file may not give you an exact accounting of all your indexed data. It only shows the top 10 busiest indexes for each 30 second sampling period. For example, if you have 50 active indexes, you cannot expect to see all of them accounted for in events from metrics.log.
  </p>

<h2>Fill ratio of data processing queues</h2>
  <p>
    As data flows through Splunk Enterprise data pipelines, it passes through through several pipelines and is buffered in queues. The fill ratio of these queues, measured over time, allows you to see periods in which data processing becomes bottlenecked. See the Learn More help for the <a href="indexing_performance">Indexing performance view</a> for a diagram of the Splunk Enterprise data pipelines and queues.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each indexer in your Splunk distributed deployment, this panel shows the fill ratio of a given queue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click the chart of a given indexer to open a new window with the Indexing Performance view focused on that instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deselect <b>Split by indexer</b> to show an aggregate queue fill ratio for all indexers.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use this panel:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Select a queue.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Select a function to use when measuring the queue fill ratio:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>95th percentile</li>
	<li>median</li>
	<li>average</li>
	<li>maximum</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can exclude the search-head from the results by deselecting the <b>Include search-head</b> checkbox.</p></li>
    <li><p>Click a given indexer to drill down for details in the Indexing Performance view. (Opens in a new window.)</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Searches used in this view</h2>  
  <p>
    Click the <b>View results</b> link in each panel to open the search in the Search view. You can inspect, modify, and export the search results from the Search view.
