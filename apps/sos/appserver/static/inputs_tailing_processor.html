      <h1>File Monitor Inputs</h1>
      <p>
	This view provides information on files monitored by Splunk Enterprise. For details about the file input processor, refer to:

      <h2>Search used in this view</h2>
      <p>
        This view uses data returned from the custom search command, <code>tpstatusquery</code>.
	This search command queries the REST endpoint for Tailing Processor file status of the target instance selected in the <b>Instance to query</b> pulldown.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You can manually access the FileStatus REST endpoint from a browser to get the status of your tailed files. For example:
      </p>
      <p><code>https://serverhost:8089/services/admin/inputstatus/TailingProcessor:FileStatus</code></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>
       See <a target="_blank" class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm" href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.inputs_tailing_processor.troubleshoot_inputs')}">Troubleshoot the input process</a> in the Splunk documentation for more information.
      </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	The <code>tpstatusquery</code> search returns one event per file or directory object listed at the endpoint, which corresponds to all files and directories monitored by that instance of splunkd.
      </p>
      <p><span style="color:#1A7996">tpstatusquery</span><br><br>
      <code>
      | tpstatusquery targetserver=<i>&lt;target server&gt;</i> namespace="system" owner="nobody" admin/inputstatus/TailingProcessor:FileStatus | table *
      </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>&lt;target server&gt;</i> is the value of the <b>host</b> field used by that instance to index _internal events.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <b>Note:</b> On systems where you are monitoring hundreds of thousands of files:
       </p>
       <ul>
	    <li>
	    <p>
	      The search command for this view can take several minutes to stream all objects from the endpoint.
	      This means that the population of the view can take a significant amount of time.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Example runtimes for one million records took about a minute before streaming results appeared in the view.
	      The last results appeared about three minutes from when the view was opened.
	    </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>
	      The search process for this command can use a non-trivial amount of memory.
	      The search process might also cause a temporary memory spike in the main splunkd process.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Example searches have temporarily used up to 2GB of memory.

      <h2>Files Monitored</h2>
      <p>
	Counts the number of files and directories being monitored.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>
	    <b>Input stanzas found</b>
	    <br />Number of Input stanzas found in inputs.conf.
	    Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/5.0.2/Admin/Inputsconf">inputs.conf.spec file</a> for more information on inputs.conf.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
	    <b>Files monitored</b><br />Number of files being monitored.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
	    <b>Files read</b><br />Number of files that that have been read.<br /><br />
	    The number of files that have been read can differ from the number of files monitored for various reasons, such as your whitelist/blacklist configuration or whether a file is missing or unreadable.
	    The Action Status option in the Monitoring status panel provides details of files monitored, but not read.
      </p></li>
      </ul>
 
    <h2>Monitoring Status</h2>
      <p>
	Breaks down the total count of monitored files based on the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>
	    <b>Action status</b>
	    <br />Shows monitored file count based on file action status: whether files are open for reading, missing, match a blacklist, and other such details.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
	    <b>Input stanza</b><br />Shows monitored file count by input stanza defined in inputs.conf.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
	    <b>Read status</b><br />Shows monitored file count based on file read status. This differentiates files that have been read or are being read 
	    from files that are ignored. Files can be ignored for various reasons, such as your whitelist/blacklist configuration,
	    whether a file is missing, or a file is unreadable.
	    Use the <b>Action status</b> selection or the chart drilldown to see why files are being ignored.
      </p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Status by file input stanza</h2>
      <p>
	Lists the input stanzas found, showing the status of monitored files associated with that input stanza.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the <b>Input stanza</b> dropdown to filter your selection. The default selection is the top ten stanzas by total monitored file count.
      </p>

      <h2>All monitored files</h2>
      <p>Run this search to return monitored files as results. Click the search button to run the search.</p>
      
      <h2>Searches used in this view</h2>  
      <p>
	Click the <b>View results</b> link in each panel to open the search in the Search view. You can inspect, modify, and export the search results from the Search view.
