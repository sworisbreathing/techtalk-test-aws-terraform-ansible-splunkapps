      <h2>About this view</h2>

      <p>
      The panels in this view show license usage for the current licenser time window, which spans back thirty days.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Load this view on your License Master instance</h3>
      <p>
      This view leverages information about license usage that is usually only available on the License Master instance. As such, this view should only be loaded on that instance.
      </p>

      <h3>Search controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Pool</b> dropdown<br />Select All Pools or a specific pool.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Split by</b> dropdown<br />Select the field to break down license usage against.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><b>no split</b>, <b>indexer</b>, <b>pool</b><br />Populates the panel with data from license_usage.log. If your License Master is down at its local midnight, it does not generate a RolloverSummary event for that day &ndash; that day's data does not appear in the panels.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>source</b>, <b>source type</b>, <b>host</b><br />Populates the panel by aggregating the usage statistics reported by the slaves every minute into one-day data points. Splunk recommends accelerating the search that powers these panels.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Version compatibility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Splunk Enterprise 5.x</b><br />This view is supported on these versions.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Splunk Enterprise 6.x</b><br />This view has been disabled for Splunk Enterprise 6.0 and later. These versions ship with a <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.0/Admin/AboutSplunksLicenseUsageReportView" target=_blank" class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm">built-in License Usage Report View</a>.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Troubleshooting this view</h3>
      <p>Common reasons for data not to show in this view:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The view is not being consulted on the License Master instance.</p></li>
        <li><p>The license_usage.log file created on the License Master is not being indexed.</p></li>
        <li><p>The license_usage.log file is being indexed but its events are being forwarded to instances which are not reachable by distributed search from the License Master.</p></li>
        <li><p>If your license master instance is down at its local midnight, it does not generate a RolloverSummary event for that day, and you do not see that day's data in these panels.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Accelerating the searches for this view</h2>
      <p>
      Acceleration for the searches powering this view is disabled by default. Acceleration of searches apply to the following split-by selections, which are powered by one datacube-generating search named <a href="../../manager/sos/saved/searches/sos_license_usage_datacube?action=edit&ns=sos" target="_blank">sos_license_usage_datacube</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>host</b></p></li>
        <li><p><b>source</b></p></li>
        <li><p><b>source type</b></p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      <a href="../../manager/sos/saved/searches/sos_license_usage_datacube?action=edit&ns=sos" target="_blank">Enable acceleration for the "sos_license_usage_datacube" search</a>, but only on the License Master instance. Note that depending on the amount of data already available, it may take a significant amount of time for the summary to be fully built.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Squashing</h2>
      <p>
      Periodically the indexer reports to the license manager the data indexed, broken down by source, sourcetype, host, and index. If the number of distinct (source, source type, host, index) tuples in these reports grows over the squash_threshold, Splunk Enterprise squashes the host and source values and only reports a breakdown by sourcetype and pool.
      </p>
      <p>
      The squashing threshold is configurable in server.conf. You can <b>very carefully</b> increase the squash_threshold in the [license] stanza of the license slaves. Note that the sourcetype field is not subject to squashing.
      </p>
