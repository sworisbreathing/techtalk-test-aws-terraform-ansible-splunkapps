  <h1>HTTP Response Times For splunkd</h1>
  <p>
  This view exposes high response times for HTTP requests serviced by the
  <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Splunkd" target="_blank">splunkd</a> back-end server.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the most common scenario, the initiator/client for these requests is
  <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Splunkweb" target="_blank">Splunk Web</a>,
  the front-end HTTP server powering the graphical user interface that users directly interact with.
  Of course, other clients such as the Splunk Enterprise CLI or SDKs can be the initiators of these requests.
  </p>
  <p>
  For more information on the splunkd and Splunk Web processes, refer to
  <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Splunksarchitectureandwhatgetsinstalled" target="_blank">this documentation topic</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  These HTTP requests served by splunkd target endpoints of the <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Restapi" target="_blank">REST API</a>,
  as highlighted in the diagram below:
  </p>
  <img height="409" width="800" src="../../static/app/sos/images/architecture.png">
  <p>By that definition, the response times measured here are for requests between Splunk Web and splunkd,
  <b>not</b> between the client's browser and Splunk Web.</p>
  <p>The primary source of events for the searches in this view are the HTTP access logs recorded by splunkd in
  <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd_access.log</code>.</p>
  <p>
  Some of the typical questions this view can answer are:
   <ul>
    <li><p>Are there any REST API endpoints that are taking an abnormally long time to respond to requests?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are those high response times responsible for incidents where Splunk Web will report that the splunkd daemon timed out?</p></li>
    <li><p>Can these high response times be correlated with external factors such as high system load or search concurrency?</p></li>
  </ul>
 </p>

  <h2>High response times</h2>
  <p>
  This table shows occurrences of high response times (1 second or more) to REST API requests served by splunkd.
  Use the "Aggregate results" checkbox to group events by target URI and time of occurrence.
  </p>

  <h2>High response times over time</h2>
  <p>
  This chart shows occurrences of high response times (1 second or more) to REST API requests served by splunkd,
  aggregated over time using three different statistical functions: median, 90th percentile and maximum.
  The dotted red line labeled "Splunk Web timeout threshold" is drawn at the 30-second mark.
  This represents the response time threshold above which Splunk Web shows the user an error,
  usually a "500 - internal server error" indicating a read time out from splunkd.
  </p>

  <h2>High response times against other metrics</h2>
  <p>
  Very much like the previous chart, this chart plots occurrences of high response times from splunkd.
  But this chart also allows to overlay other metrics of interest which, along with time-based correlation,
  can help to explain episodes of poor responsiveness from splunkd.
  </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> For the "search concurrency" overlay to work, you must have previously enabled the
  <code>ps_sos.sh</code> or <code>ps_sos.ps1</code> scripted inputs that track search processes.

  <h2>Searches used in this view</h2>  
  <p>
    Click the <b>View results</b> link in each panel to open the search in the Search view. You can inspect, modify, and export the search results from the Search view.
