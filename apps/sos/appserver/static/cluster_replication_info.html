      <h1>Index replication information</h1>
      <p>
	This view provides several panels for monitoring the activity of peer nodes in a Splunk Enterprise cluster.
	Information presented includes peer status, index replication errors, and data throughput with respect to index replication.
	To some extent, index replication performance is measured by examining the fill ratio of the outgoing replication queue. 
      <p>
      <p>
        For an overview of Splunk Enterprise clusters and index replication, refer to
	<a target="_blank" class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm" href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.cluster_replication_info.cluster_overview')}">About clusters and index replication</a>
	in the Splunk Enterprise documentation.
      </p>
      <h2>Cluster peer status</h2>
      <p>
	Provides an overview of peer nodes, listing which peers are registered and their status. 
      <p>
      <h2>Index replication errors &ndash; last 24 hours.</h2>
      <p>
        Lists cluster-specific errors, including bucket replications errors, starting with the most recent error.
	By default, similar errors are grouped into one entry. Deselect <b>Group similar events</b> to view all errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view errors prior to the last 24 hours, click <b>View results</b> and modify the search time window.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Outgoing network replication throughput | Incoming network replication throughput</h2>
      <p>
        These two panels provide measurements (average and maximum) and trend of bucket replication throughput between peers.
      </p>
      <h2>Fill ratio of outgoing replication queue by peer</h2>
      <p>
        Use this panel to check the outgoing queue of source peers sending replicated copies to target peers.
	
	This queue holds events to be replicated and is shared by as many buckets as there are that are being replicated.
	Events in the queue can have multiple destinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The queue can become backed up if one or more target peers are slow in receiving data.
	In this case, check the <a href="indexing_distributed" target="_blank">Distributed Indexing Performance view</a> to look for a possible indexing bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Function specifies how to measure the Fill ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bucket Span specifies the time span between data points on the Time axis.
      </p>
