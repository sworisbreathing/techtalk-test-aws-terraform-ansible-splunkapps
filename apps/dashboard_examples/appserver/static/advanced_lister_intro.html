<h1>Advanced XML: Introduction to lister modules</h1>
<p>
  Use lister modules to add lists to your dashboards. The examples on this page (and other lister pages) show various ways to use listers to
  link to other views. There is a wide range of possible configurations for listers. These are some of the more common ones.  
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> You can also use tables and charts to link to other views. This clickable behavior is referred to as <i>drilldown</i> behavior.
  Refer to the <a href="drilldown_intro">drilldown examples</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
    There are two types of lister modules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Entity lister</b><br />Builds lists from Splunk objects, such as users, saved searches, and others.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Search lister</b><br />Builds list from searches run in a module.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The lister examples below show various ways to combine lister modules in a panel.
    The last lister example illustrates the complexity you can have when combining and nesting various modules in a panel.
