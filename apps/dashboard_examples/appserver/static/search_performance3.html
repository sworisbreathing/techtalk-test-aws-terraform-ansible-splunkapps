<h1>Advanced XML: Search performance 3</h1>
<p>
    This is the third example on search performance. This example puts back the FlashTimeline module removed in search performance 2.
    But it continues to use the HiddenFieldPicker module because of the perfomance gains it provides.
</p>
<p>
    As with search performance 2, the HiddenFieldPicker hard codes the following fields: host, index, source, sourcetype, clientip, status, and bytes. The user still cannot
    choose which fields to display.   
</p>
<p>
    There is still a significant perfomance improvement gained by not using the FieldPicker module.
</p>
<p>
    Technically, the searches are now submitted with status_buckets=300 again, but it doesn't really affect the perfomance significantly.
