superClass = Splunk.Module

description = This module can retrieve one or more field values from the first row of the current search results and make those field names and values available to downstream modules as regular $fieldName$ keys.  The search results may have more than one row but the module will only pull field values from the first row.

[param:fields]
required = True
label = Enter the fields whose values you wish to make available to downstream modules. You may enter a single field name, or a comma-separated list of fields. 

[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.utils.forEachModuleWithCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback); See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.
