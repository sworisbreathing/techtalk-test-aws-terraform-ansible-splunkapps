<h1>Topology by Server Role</h1>
<p>
This view provides a graphic representation of Splunk Enterprise instances that S.o.S discovers in your deployment.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> For Splunk Enterprise version 4.x, this view requires. A restart is not required for Splunk Enterprise 5.x or later. 
</p>
<p>
Click on a node to display details about that node. Details are available only for instances accessible by distributed search (typically, the current search-head and the search peers).
</p>
<p>
To automatically discover the nodes in your Splunk Enterprise topology, S.o.S relies on scheduled searches that populate and maintain lookup tables. S.o.S automatically discovers the following types of nodes:
</p>
<ul>
      <li><p>The local instance of Splunk Enterprise</p></li>
      <li><p>Search peers</p></li>
      <li><p>The search-head it is installed on and any search-heads in the same pool</p></li>
      <li><p>Forwarders</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>sos_refresh_splunk_servers_cache</code> scheduled search runs when S.o.S is installed and also every 5 minutes thereafter. It creates and refreshes the <code>splunk_servers_cache.csv</code> that lists Splunk Enterprise instances accessible by means of distributed search.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the <code>sos_refresh_splunk_forwarders_cache</code> scheduled search creates and refreshes the <code>splunk_forwarders_cache.csv</code> that lists forwarders sending in data. This search runs every 15 minutes.
</p>

<h2>Topology overlays</h2>
<p>Use the overlay drop-down menu to select overlays for the Splunk Enterprise instance representations in the view. The overlays provide a snapshot of instance status or resource usage for your environment.</p>


<h3>The following overlays are available once the inputs are enabled:</h3>

<ul>
      <li><p><b>No overlay</b><br />Select to remove any overlays from the view.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Status</b><br />A black overlay with a down circle graphic indicates instances that are down. Discovered instances in your environment that are up and running will have a green overlay.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Memory</b><br />Provides an indication of memory usage of the main splunkd process by instances in your environment. Overlays for memory usage are color coded based on the following thresholds:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><p><b>Green</b><br />Overlay is green for instances that indicate 2GB or less physical memory usage of the main splunkd process</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Yellow</b><br />Overlay is yellow for instances that indicate between 2GB and 4GB physical memory usage of the main splunkd process</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Orange</b><br />Overlay is orange for instances that indicate more than 4GB physical memory usage of the main splunkd process</p></li>
          <li><p><b>None</b><br />No color overlay is applied to instances for which we have no resource usage information. See below for instructions on how to enable the data inputs necessary to this feature.</p></li>
      </ul> </li>

      <li><p><b>CPU</b><br />Provides an indication of CPU usage of the main splunkd process by instances in your environment. Overlays for CPU usage are color coded based on the following thresholds:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><p><b>Green</b><br />Overlay is green for instances that indicate 200% (2 cores) or less CPU usage of the main splunkd process</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Yellow</b><br />Overlay is yellow for instances that indicate between 200% (2 cores) and 400% (4 cores) CPU usage of the main splunkd process</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Orange</b><br />Overlay is orange for instances that indicate more than 400% (4 cores) CPU usage of the main splunkd process</p></li>
          <li><p><b>None</b><br />No color overlay is applied to instances for which we have no resource usage information. See below for instructions on how to enable the data inputs necessary to this feature.</p></li>
      </ul>


</li>

</ul>




<h2>Don't see everything in your Splunk topology?</h2>

<p>
Any instance that is not accessible by means of a distributed search (such as a stand-alone search head or a deployment server) cannot be found by S.o.S's auto-discovery scheduled search. You can manually add additional nodes from your deployment to the <code>splunk_servers_cache.csv</code> lookup table using the following procedure. Server details of manually added nodes are not available for display.
</p>
<p>
      <b>Note: </b>This procedure not only updates this topology view, but also populates the <b>Instance to query</b> dropdown available in other views.
</p>
<p><b>To manually add a node to the lookup table:</b></p>
<ol>
      <li>
      <p>
      Navigate to the <code>splunk_servers_cache.csv</code> lookup table and open it in a text editor:
      </p>
      <p>
            <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sos/lookups/splunk_servers_cache.csv</code>
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
       Add an entry for each node you want to add, specifying only the first two comma-separated values (sos_server and server_role) for the lookup table.
      </p>
      <p>
      <p><b>sos_server</b><br />The name of the server. The value that this Splunk Enterprise instance uses to write to the _internal and sos indexes, as defined in inputs.conf. Usually, this is the server's hostname.</p>
      <p><b>server_role</b><br />The role of the server in your deployment. Allowed values: forwarder, indexer, search-head, search-peer.</p>
      <p><b>Note: </b>Be careful to specify the server_role values correctly. S.o.S ignores entries that do not match exactly.</p>
      </p>
      </li>
      <p>S.o.S refreshes the table every 5 minutes, reformatting the entries you add.</p>
      <p>For more information on the <code>splunk_servers_cache.csv</code> lookup table, its customization possibilities and maintenance, refer to the following spec file:</p>
      <p>
            <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sos/lookups/splunk_servers.cache.csv.spec</code>
      </p>
</ol>

<h2>Data overlays are not showing?</h2>
<p>The Memory and CPU overlays rely on events from the <code>ps_sos.sh</code> (Linux/Unix) or <code>ps_sos.ps1</code> (Windows) scripted inputs.</p>

<p>To collect resource usage information from indexers and other instances not local to the S.o.S app, install the <i>Splunk on Splunk technology add-on</i> on those instances. The S.o.S technology add-on is available for Unix/Linux and Windows and can be downloaded from Splunkbase:<br>
  <ul>    
    <li><a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/870" target="_blank"class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm">S.o.S TA for Unix and Linux</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/1177" target="_blank"class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm">S.o.S TA for Windows</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Enable the ps_sos.sh (Unix/Linux) or ps_sos.ps1 (Windows) scripted input</p></b>
<p>You must enable the ps_sos.sh (Unix/Linux) or ps_sos.ps1 (Windows) scripted inputs for the Memory and CPU overlays to display any data. To do so, go to <a target="_blank" href="../../../manager/sos/data/inputs/script" target="_blank">Manager > Data Inputs > Scripts</a>, look for the following data input and enable it:</p>
  <p><code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sos/bin/ps_sos.sh</code> (on Unix/Linux systems)</p>
  <p><code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sos/bin/ps_sos.ps1</code> (on Windows systems)</p>



<h2>Splunk Enterprise cluster environment</h2>
<p>
This view does not identify the cluster-specific role of Splunk Enterprise instances in a cluster environment. The roles identified in this view are from the perspective of distributed search.
Typically, the view identifies the master as a search head (which it is) and the cluster peers as search peers (which they are).
