  <h1>Scheduler Activity</h1>
  <p>
  Use the Scheduler Activity view to analyze perfomance of scheduled searches.
  Each panel has a View Results link to drill down for more information.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Scheduler Activity</h2>
  <p>Lists scheduled searches. The searches listed depends on how you filter the view.</p>
  <p>This panel can help determine which scheduled search could be causing performance problems.
     For example, a search that has been executed significantly more times than the others, and also has a high median
     runtime, could be a candidate for causing performance issues.
  </p>
  <p>Drill down to specific searches by clicking on the graph or the legend. You can also click the View Results link.</p>
  <p>
 <p><b>To filter the searches displayed:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Select an app from the App dropdown list of apps that have scheduled searches.</p></li>
    <li><p>Select a scheduled search from the Scheduled search dropdown list.<br>The searches available depend on the app selected.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  
  <h2>Execution Count</h2>
  <p>
    Lists the scheduled searches that have been fired over time. Filter the output by app name or saved search name.
    Each bar of the graph indicates the scheduled searches that have been started within the indicated time span. 
    The color code on the bar indicates either the app name or the scheduled search name, depending on your selection.
    Select from the bucket span to change the time span to analyze.
  </p>
  <p>Drill down to specific searches by clicking on the graph or the legend.</p>
  <p>
    Typically, in this view, you look for anomalies in the graph.
    If you find spikes indicating many searches are started at the same time,
    consider rescheduling the starting time for some of the searches to spread them more evenly over time.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Skipped vs Executed Scheduled Searches</h2>
  <p>Indicates which searches have been skipped.</p>
  <p>
    Skipped searches can occur for a number of reasons. Often this happens when a scheduled search
    exceeds its time, preventing another search from starting.  A high number of searches scheduled
    to begin at the same time can overlap and result in skipped searches if the Splunk Enterprise instance is
    near its maximum number of concurrent searches allowed.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Skipped Scheduled Searches</h2>
  <p>Lists all scheduled searches that have been skipped. Click on a search to drill down for details.
  
  <h2>Scheduler Errors</h2>
  <p>If errors have been logged against scheduled searches, lists the search, user, error, and time of the search.
  
  <h2>Alert Actions Fired</h2>
  <p>Lists alert actions that have fired from a schedules search. Alert actions can include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Send email</p></li>
    <li><p>Summary indexing</p></li>
    <li><p>Script execution</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Searches used in this view</h2>  
  <p>
    Click the <b>View results</b> link in each panel to open the search in the Search view. You can inspect, modify, and export the search results from the Search view.
