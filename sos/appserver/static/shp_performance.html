    <h1>Search Head Pooling Performance</h1>
    <p>
    Use this view to analyze the usage and performance of the NFS shared storage that hosts the files and directories shared by all members of a search head pool. The data presented highlights the relationship between usage and performance both at the storage (NFS) and application (Splunk Enterprise) levels.
    </p>
    
    <h2>About this view</h2>
    <p>
        The following requirements need to be fulfilled for this view to present information:
        <ul>
            <li><p>Search head pooling is configured in your deployment.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <code>nfs-iostat_sos.py</code> scripted input is enabled on each search head of the pool. This data input collects NFS metrics for usage and performance of the shared storage device used by the search head pool.</p></li>
            <li><p>The view is loaded on a search head member of the pool <b>or</b> all search heads in the pool forward the events they collect to the indexers (this is the recommended approach).</p></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Panels in this view</h2>

    <h3>Pooling Shared Storage &ndash; I/O Throughput vs. Performance</h3>
    <p>This panel compares usage vs. performance at the <b>storage</b> level by overlaying two key metrics captured by the <code>nfs-iostat_sos.py</code> scripted input:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>IOps</b> &ndash; I/O operations per second that splunkd imposes on the shared storage device.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>RTT</b> &ndash; Round trip time, in milliseconds, for three particular I/O operations: access(), getattr() and lookup(). These types of I/O operations represent the bulk of the workload that splunkd places on the shared storage device.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Splunk UI and Search &ndash; Usage vs. Responsiveness</h3>
    <p>This panel compares usage vs. performance at the <b>application</b> level by overlaying some key metrics captured in Splunk Enterprise internal logs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Search dispatch time</b> &ndash; The time (in seconds) it takes for splunkd to service an ad hoc search request initiated by a user from Splunk Web.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>View service time</b> &ndash; The time (in seconds) for splunkd to serve a view in Splunk Web following a user request.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Search concurrency</b> &ndash; The number of searches running concurrently at a specific time.</p></li>
    </ul>
         
    <h3>Top 10 IOps Peaks by Host</h3>
    <p>This panel displays the top ten busiest moments in terms of total IOps serviced by the shared storage device, split by host in the search head pool.</p>
    
    <h3>IOps per Operation Category</h3>
    <p>This panel measures the IOps imposed by splunkd on the shared storage device, grouped by major operation category.</p>
