      <h1>Cluster master view</h1>
      <p>This view queries the master node of a Splunk Enterprise cluster to provide an overview of the cluster.<p>

      <p>This view shows results only if you access it from a cluster master. It does not display data if you access the view from any other instance in a cluster.</p>

      <p>If you are running Splunk Enterprise 6, consult the <a href="cluster_master_info" target="_blank">updated version of this view</a>.</p>

      <p>
        For an overview of Splunk Enterprise clusters and index replication, refer to
	<a target="_blank" class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm" href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.cluster_master_info.cluster_overview')}">About clusters and index replication</a>
	in the Splunk Enterprise documentation.
      </p>
      <h2>Cluster replication info</h2>
      <p>Provides an overview of your cluster configuration.</p>
	    
      <h2>Bucket count</h2>
      <p>
	Provides a visualization of the relative number of bucket copies, by index or peer, in a cluster. The bucket count includes the primary bucket and all copies.
      <p>
      <p>
	Mouse over each area of the chart to view the actual number of replicated buckets present in each index or peer.
      </p>
      <h2>Peer bucket count by status</h2>
      <p>
        View the number of bucket copies for each peer, based on the bucket replication (complete or in-flight) or searchable (searchable or unsearchable) status.
      </p>
      <p>
	Use the logarithmic scale when you encounter large counts from a single peer.
      </p>
      <h2>Bucket information</h2>
      <p>
	View details about each bucket in your cluster, listed by index. Note that each result in the table shows a unique *bucket ID*, which will exist as several copies on the cluster peers.
	
	Peer bucket status column shows peers holding copies of a specific bucket, indicating those that hold <span class="primary">primary</span>, <span class="searchable">searchable</span>, or <span class="unsearchable">unsearchable copies</span>.
      <p>
