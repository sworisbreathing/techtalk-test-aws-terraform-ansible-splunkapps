      <h1>Dispatch Directory Inspector</h1>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 30px">
      <p>
	This view provides insight into search artifacts stored in the dispatch directory, which you can find at the following location in your Splunk Enterprise installation:
      </p>
      <p>
	<code>$SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk/dispatch/</code>
      </p>
      <p>
	When you run a search job, Splunk stores its results as an artifact in this directory, including information about the search such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><p>The search string</p></li>
	<li><p>The unique search ID</p></li>
	<li><p>The TTL of the artifact (the time the artifacts remain on disk)</p></li>
	<li><p>The user running the search job</p></li>
	<li><p>The roles to which the user belongs</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	The list of current search artifacts is gathered using the <code><a href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.dispatch_inspector.rest')}" target="_blank">rest</a></code> search command against the <a href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.dispatch_inspector.api_search_jobs')}" target="_blank">search/jobs</a> REST endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong>
        The <code><a href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.dispatch_inspector.rest')}" target="_blank">rest</a></code> search command that is needed for this view is only available in Splunk Enterprise 4.3 or later versions. As a result, this view is not compatible with Splunk Enterprise 4.2.x and earlier versions.
      </p>
      <p>
	For more information on search artifacts and the dispatch directory, refer to <a href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.dispatch_inspector.job_management_OS')}" target="_blank">Manage jobs in the OS</a> and <a href="${generateSelfHelpLink('sos.dispatch_inspector.job_management')}" target="_blank">Supervise your search jobs</a>. Both links are in the Splunk Enterprise documentation.

    <h2>Inventory of search artifacts</h2>
      <p>
	This panel lists all search artifacts found in the dispatch directory. Sort the table by different columns to gain insight on the contents of the dispatch directory. For example, sort on <b>diskUsageMB</b> to see which artifacts might have large disk space footprints. Or sort on <b>TTL</b> to see how long the search artifacts remain on disk.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Note:</b> Typically, this view is most interesting for scheduled searches. Deselect <b>Show scheduled searches only</b> to include historical searches.
      </p>
 
    <h2>Breakdown of dispatch directory disk usage</h2>

      <p>
	This panel breaks down the search artifact information differently to provide additional insights into the contents of the dispatch directory. The search populating this panel aggregates statistics such as disk usage or artifact count by search name, user, or app. This allows you to rapidly find a common denominator for the heavier consumers of disk space in the dispatch directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Note:</b> Typically, this view is most interesting for scheduled searches. Deselect <b>Show scheduled searches only</b> to include historical searches.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Searches used in this view</h2>  
      <p>
	Click the <b>View results</b> link in each panel to open the search in the Search view. You can inspect, modify, and export the search results from the Search view.
