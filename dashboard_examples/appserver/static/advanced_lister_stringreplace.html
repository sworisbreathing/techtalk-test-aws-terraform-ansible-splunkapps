<h1>Listers and stringreplace intentions</h1>
<p>
    This example shows how to use <i>stringreplace</i> intentions instead of <i>addterm</i> intentions.
    Stringreplace is an alternative to addterm that is a bit more complicated and has some minor drawbacks.
    But it is useful if you want to do more than just add searchterms and key value pairs to the search.
</p>
<p>
    Both panels contain a two-lister example that uses stringreplace intentions.
    The intention is created before the base search exists. This is counterintuitive but is perfectly acceptable and often very useful.
