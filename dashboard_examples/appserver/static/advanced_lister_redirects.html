<h1>Two listers using charts and redirects</h1>
<p>
    This view contains two SearchSelectLister modules. The second SearchSelectLister is dependent on the first one.
    In between the listers is a HiddenChartFormatter plus JSChart pattern.
</p>
<p>
    Because the chart is a child of the first lister, it offers a richer view into the second lister's choices.
    Basically, the chart offers the same options as the second lister.
</p>
    
<p>
    The JSChart modules  do not offer drilldown functionality with click interactions.
    However, they can be combined with other module patterns to achieve the same effect.
    Using a SubmitButton plus ViewRedirector, the results open in a separate view.
