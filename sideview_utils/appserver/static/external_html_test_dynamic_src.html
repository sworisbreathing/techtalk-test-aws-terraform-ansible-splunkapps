<div style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:0px 10px;">
    <h3>This content is loaded from an external file</h3>
    <p>
        More precisely, you'll find this content in the app at <b>/appserver/static/external_html_test_dynamic_src.html</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a URL that has "?dynamic_key=_dynamic_src" in it,  then all is well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        And by the way,  here are some dynamic keys: <br>
        $$foo$$ = $foo$  (should say 17)<br>
        $$bar$$ = $bar$  (should say 256, *if* the URL has bar=256 in it)<br>
    </p>
