  <h1>Bucket Fix-up Activity</h1>

  <p>This view shows results only if you access it from a cluster master node. It does not display data if you access the view from any other instance in a cluster.</p>

  <p>If you are running Splunk Enterprise 6, consult the <a href="cluster_fixup_activity" target="_blank">updated version of this view</a>.</p>

  <h2>Count of buckets to fix, by reason</h2>
  <p>Provides a count of buckets that are in need of fixing, grouped by fix reason.</p>

  <h2>List of buckets to fix, by reason</h2>

  <h2>List of buckets to fix</h2>

  <h2>Recent bucket-fixing activity</h2>

  <h2>Generation-blocking bucket fixes</h2>
  <p>Displays two tables:
    <ul>
      <li><p>The first table indicates whether the cluster can publish a new generation.</p></li>
      <li><p>The second table provides a list of buckets with less than one searchable copy. Buckets with less than one searchable copy are the primary blockers for the publication of a new generation.</p></li>
    </ul>
