      <h1>File descriptor usage</h1>
      <p>
	Use this view to analyze the file descriptor usage of the main Splunk Enterprise processes: splunkd and Splunk Web. This view can help you find spikes or leaks (this occurs when a process is not freeing unused descriptors while continuing to create new ones) in file descriptor usage. The latest usage panels help you determine the type of usage, while the file descriptor usage over time panel helps you trend that usage over time and per process.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Note: </b>At this time, this view is operative only on Linux and UNIX systems as it relies on events gathered by the lsof_sos.sh data input.
      </p>

      <p>To display statistics for search peers, install the <i>Splunk on Splunk Add-on</i> on those instances.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/870" target="_blank"class="spl-icon-external-link-xsm">S.o.S Add-on for UNIX and Linux</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Enable the lsof_sos.sh scripted input</h2>
      <p>
	You must enable the lsof_sos.sh scripted input for this view to display any data. To enable this view, go to <a target="_blank" href="../../../manager/sos/data/inputs/script">Manager > Data Inputs > Scripts</a>. Look for the following data input and enable it:
      </p>
      <p><code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sos/bin/lsof_sos.sh</code></p>

      <p>
	After you enable the scripted input, S.o.S starts gathering resource usage information, sending it to the <code>sos</code> index.
      </p>
      <p><b>Note: </b>The data gathered by this input counts against the daily licensed volume.</p>
      
    <h2>Latest file descriptor usage for splunkd and Splunk Web</h2>
      <p>
        The two panels on the left provide the latest count and distribution of the file descriptors used by the splunkd process.
      </p>
      <p>
	The two panels on the right display the same information for the Splunk Web process.
      </p>
      <p>
	Mouse over slices in the pie charts to view additional information.
      </p>
      <p><b>Note: </b>The results displayed are from the last reading taken by the lsof_sos.sh script, which runs at 10 minute intervals. Typically, this reading is fairly current, but in some scenarios could represent older data. </p>
 
    <h2>File descriptor usage over time by process</h2>
      <p>
        The bottom panel tracks file descriptor usage over time. Use this panel to discover undesirable patterns such as spikes or leaks in file descriptor usage that might indicate problems.
      </p>
