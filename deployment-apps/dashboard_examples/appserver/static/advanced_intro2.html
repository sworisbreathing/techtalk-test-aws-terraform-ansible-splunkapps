<h1>Advanced XML: How modules work</h1>

<p>  
  As mentioned in the <a href="advanced_hello">Advanced XML: Hello World</a>, when a module contains another module,
  the contained module (child module) inherits whatever <i>changes</i> are affected by the first module (the parent module).
  There are several kinds of modules, but you can think of them as falling into two major types:
</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>Modules that build a search</p>
  <p>Modules that don't build a search</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Modules that build a search</h2>  
<p> 
  You can tie together several modules to build a search that is kicked off as a job.
  To build a search, you need a base search string from a search module. For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>SearchBar</p>
  <p>HiddenSearch</p>
  <p>HiddenSavedSearch</p>
  <p>other search module</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Then, you can add an optional start time argument and an optional end time argument.
</p>
<p>
  Then add <i>intentions</i>. Intentions are layers added to the base search, typically by interactive elements in the interface,
  that affect the eventual search that is run.
</p>

<h3>Intentions</h3>  
<p>
  Most views contain a <i>base search string</i> &ndash; if you don't explicitly set one, it is implicitly "*".
</p>
<p>
  SearchBar, HiddenSearch, and HiddenSavedSearch are the most common modules that specify the base search.
</p>
<p>
  On top of that base search, other modules can layer intentions such as
  <code>addterm</code>, <code>stringreplace</code>, <code>plot</code>, <code>negateterm</code>, <code>addtermgt</code> and others.
</p>

<p>
  Each of those intentions can be added on top of <b>any base search string</b>, affecting the search that gets run.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, the base search and all the intentions layered on top of it reach a module
  that requires that kicks off the search (for example, JobStatus, EventsViewer, FlashTimeline, and others).
  The base search plus the intentions becomes flattened into the search that runs.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> The stringreplace intention is a bit of an outlier because it requires the base search string to contain embedded tokens ($foo$, for example).
</p>

<h2>Modules that don't build a search</h2>  

<p>  
  This covers a huge set of diverse modules &ndash; everything from setting the type of chart (for example, pie chart, line chart, and others)
  to setting the number of results per page, to changing sort order,
  to specific information about objects the user clicked since the view loaded.
