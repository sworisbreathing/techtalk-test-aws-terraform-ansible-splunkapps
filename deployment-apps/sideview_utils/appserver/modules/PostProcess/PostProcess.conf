[module]
className = Splunk.Module.PostProcess

superClass = Splunk.Module.DispatchingModule

description = This module allows you to set the 'postProcess' argument to the splunk search API.  Any $foo$ tokens in the string will be substituted with the dynamic values from upstream UI modules. Make sure to read all documentation within the Sideview Utils app for many more key details.  

[param:search]
required = True
label = This is the splunk search that should be used to filter or transform the results of the current search job.  In the end it is as though this search were tacked onto the end of the initial search.  Note that certain subtle guidelines must be followed for this to work correctly. It is recommended that you download the UI Examples app and carefully study the view called "Advanced XML > Using Postprocess on Dashboards".

[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.utils.forEachModuleWithCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback); See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.
